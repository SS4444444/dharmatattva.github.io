  <h1>About Dharma Tatva</h1>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    Dharma Tatva is a knowledge movement — not bound by borders, beliefs, or ideologies.
    <br><br>
    Born from a single idea — that dharma means duty — we exist to question, explore, and reimagine the world through sharp inquiry and unfiltered truth. At Dharma Tatva, we dive deep into the forces that shape our lives: from economics and power structures to culture, science, spirituality, and history. We don’t sell narratives. We unpack them.
    <br><br>
    Our mission is to build an informed community that understands its role in the larger fabric of society — not as passive consumers, but as conscious participants. Through video series, discussions, and public collaborations, we spark dialogue, inspire responsibility, and ignite change.
    <br><br>
    We are awareness-centric.
    <br>
    We are not right or left. We are depth-driven.
    <br><br>
    This isn’t just content — it’s a continuum. An exploration of what lies between God & Man, behind global power games, inside civilizations, and beyond the boundaries of science.
    <br><br>
    <strong>This is our bit of Dharma.<br>Do your bit.</strong>
